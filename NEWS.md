# gt 0.2.0.9000 (in development)

* There are new options for numeric formatting: (1) using significant figures (with `n_sigfig` in `fmt_number`), and (2) the ability to retain/drop trailing decimal marks (with `drop_trailing_dec_mark` in `fmt_number()`, `fmt_percent()`, and `fmt_currency()`). Thank you [@drolejoel](https://github.com/drolejoel) for the suggestion in [#535](https://github.com/rstudio/gt/issues/535)! PR: [#546](https://github.com/rstudio/gt/pull/546).
