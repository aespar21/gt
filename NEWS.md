# gt 0.2.0.9000 (in development)

* The new `scale_values` argument for `fmt_percent()` makes it easy to use values that are already scaled (and just require the percent mark). Thank you @djohn215 for the suggestion in #559 (#565).

* `summary_rows()` and `grand_summary_rows()` no longer incorrectly calculate summary values in cases where rows aren't already sorted by group (#556).

* Ensure compatibility with **tibble** 3.0.0 (#557).

# gt 0.2.0.5

* New package with 80 exported functions for building display tables

# gt 0.1.0 (unreleased)
